  <div><h4>Overview</h4>
      The name Xlayout originates from the idea of two layout types: Horizontal and Vertical
      that are laid out in a cross pattern. This arrangement can be used to generate a complete border pattern
      of panels laid out in sections of north, center, south, west and east.
      Any number of nesting can be used to generate complex panel based layouts.
